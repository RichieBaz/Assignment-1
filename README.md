## 🎨 Color Scheme  
I created my scheme using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create).  

**Colors used:**  
- `#4facfe` (blue)  
- `#9d50bb` (purple)  
- `#ff7e5f` (orange)  
- `#feb47b` (peach)  
- `#f8ffae` (yellow-green)  

Gradients applied in:  
- **Laptop.css** → Horizontal linear gradient background.  
- **Mobile.css** → Vertical gradient background, angled footer gradient.  
- **Tablet.css** → Horizontal gradient with smaller layout.

## 🖼️ Media  
- **Image (me.jpg)** → About Me page, with alt text.  
- **Poster (poster.jpg)** → Used as video thumbnail.  
- **Video (mp4.mp4)** → Embedded with `<video>` and poster image.

## 📱 Responsive Design  
I created **three CSS files** for devices:  
- **laptop.css** → Fonts bigger, video fixed width.  
- **tablet.css** → Smaller video, wrapper 95%.  
- **mobile.css** → Full-width video, submit button 100%.
